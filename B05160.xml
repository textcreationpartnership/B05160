         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And now finding that the toune of <hi>Berwick</hi> is ſeaſed on, and that the dangers are nearer to us then formerly, whether from Sectaries or Malignants, and that it is our dutie to make uſe of the power and ſtrength of the Kingdom for its preſervation and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, And for preventing thoſe evils wherewith wee are threatned, have thought it therefore fitting to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the ſeveral Collonels and Committees of warre
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:176082:4"/>of the Shires on this ſide <hi>Tay,</hi> to meet upon the ninth of this inſtant, and theſe on this ſide of <hi>Spey</hi> upon the twelfe, and thoſe upon the North ſide thereof upon the ſixteenth day of the ſame moneth, and at their ſaid meetings, to take preſent courſe for liſting and intolling the particular numbers of men, horſe &amp; foot, according to the liſt hereunto ſubjoyned.

Marks from every Heretor and others aforeſaid, who are lyable to put him out. And for every Footman wanting, the ſum of 100. l. And further the ſaids Eſtates declares, that the Heretors and others aforeſaid failing in puting out of their proportions ſhall be eſteemed as enemies to, and hinderers of the publick ſervice of the Kingdom, in perſuance of the ends of the Covenant, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome perſons may be hereby overburdened in reſpect of the meanes of their rents, and multitude of Tennants, living upon their lands: Yet the Eſtates Ordains the foreſaid Number of men providit as aforeſaid to be put out by them, and incaſe any of them finde themſelves thereby prejudged, and make their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:176082:5"/>complaint known to the Committee of the Shire, in that caſe the ſaids Eſtates Odains the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Shire to caſt up the accompt, what the price of the aforſaid Armes Levi-mony and price of baggage-horſe will amount to, and ſo to provide for their relief, that the burthen may be equally upon the whole Heretories and others aforeſaid according to their rent, as in the maintenance.

And ſeeing the preſent ſervice will neceſſarily require a greater number of Horſe; and that the Shires of this Kingdom will hardly be able to outreik the ſame: Therefore the ſaids Eſtates have ordained that each Regiment of horſe ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of 180.
